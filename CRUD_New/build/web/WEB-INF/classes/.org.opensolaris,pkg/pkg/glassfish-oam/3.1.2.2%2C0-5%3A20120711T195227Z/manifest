set name=pkg.description value="GlassFish OAM Integration provides a GlassFish provider that integrates with OAM (Oracle Access Manager) for authentication. The provider is implemented as a JSR196 module and works in two modes - as an Identity Asserter when it is front-ended by a WebGate plugin and as an Authenticator, when it directly receives user requests. This module requires you install Oracle Access Manager SDK. GlassFish Server is a modular, lightweight, and extensible Java EE 6 application server built on OSGi. Key features include fast startup time, improved developer productivity, hybrid OSGi/Java EE applications, high availability clustering, centralized administration, and overall ease-of-use."
